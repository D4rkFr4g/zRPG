AUTHORS: Zane Melcho
USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Avoid radioactive goo and flying chickens to make it to the exit of the level.


Known issues:	
? Shooting animation frame is slightly clipped
? Player Collider box doesn't shrink when jumping to match animation
? On falling there is no bottom so player continually falls and can cause camera scrolling
? Chickens currently can spawn over starting location causing instant death.
? Collision with goo tiles seems to trigger too soon when walking towards it
